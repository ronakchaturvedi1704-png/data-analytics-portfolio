# Ordering and Limiting Analysis using SQL

## Overview
This project focuses on sorting and limiting SQL query results to identify top and bottom records based on defined criteria.

## Dataset
The dataset contains numerical and categorical data suitable for ranking and comparison.

## Tools Used
- SQL

## Analysis Performed
- Used ORDER BY to sort results in ascending and descending order
- Applied LIMIT to restrict the number of records returned
- Identified top-performing and lowest-performing entries
- Combined filtering with ordering for targeted analysis

## Key Learnings
- Ranking data effectively
- Controlling result set size
- Writing efficient analytical queries
