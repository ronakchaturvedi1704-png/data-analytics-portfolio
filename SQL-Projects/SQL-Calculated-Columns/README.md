# Calculated Columns Analysis using SQL

## Overview
This project focuses on creating calculated columns using SQL expressions to derive new insights from existing data.

## Dataset
The dataset contains raw numerical and categorical fields from which additional metrics are calculated.

## Tools Used
- SQL

## Analysis Performed
- Created calculated columns using arithmetic operations
- Used CASE statements to generate categorical insights
- Derived new metrics from existing columns
- Analyzed how calculated fields improve data understanding

## Key Learnings
- Writing SQL expressions for derived columns
- Using CASE for conditional logic
- Enhancing datasets with meaningful computed values
